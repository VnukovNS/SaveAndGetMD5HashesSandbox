# SaveAndGetMD5HashesSandbox
This is a tutorial application aimed at learning how the services work

So far, the application has implemented only saving and retrieving, as well as checking the uniqueness of the MD5Hash.
If MD5Hash is missing in the list, it is added.

Refactoring of the code to match SOLID is planned for the future, as well as the implementation of the search with the service.
